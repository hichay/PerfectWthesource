## Thank You ##
Before installing I would like to thank you for purchasing my script, The following is a detailed README on how to install the script and explaining some of the config a little.
Installation is extremely simple, more updates to come in the future. Please send me suggestions on Discord and I'll consider adding them in.

To install the script you need to drag the script into your resrouces folder and add the following into your server.cfg

`start opod-artheist`

Then goto your database and upload the SQL file, use whichever version of ESX your using, e.g if your using ESX 1.1 use ESX 1.1.sql

Then it should work no issues if you have any issues though feel free to contact me on discord
